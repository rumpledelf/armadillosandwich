<h2>Actors/Models</h2>

Seeking people of any size, shape or colour to be models or actors for the Photographic and Videographic dictionaries.

Videos are all around 10-15 seconds long and are generally done in one take outside with a phone rather than inside in a fancy studio. Most filming is happening in Sydney around Newtown, Sydney CBD or UNSW's Kensington campus.

If you are interested, I am taking people as individuals or groups on an ongoing ad-hoc basis.

You can also film by yourself and send raw videos to me so I can add them to the site YouTube channel. Please get in touch first if you are interested in doing this as there tends to be a list of words that are required rather than accepting unsolicited content.

Paying $1 per video.
