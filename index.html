Armadillo Sandwich is an umbrella style company responsible for, among other things, maintaining the <a href="https://photographicdictionary.com" rel="nofollow">Photographic Dictionary</a> and <a href="http://videographicdictionary.com" rel="nofollow">Videographic Dictionary</a> websites.

<p>
The sites currently appeal to older, educated women with children. I get very positive feedback from people who have children with learning disabilities or relatives with brain injuries. I am currently adding some new features to the sites that will increase the usefulness of the sites to these demographics based on this feedback.

<p>
I am currently seeking funding to increase the viewership of these sites, by creating more content and marketing that content to a broader audience. The appeal of these sites will only increase as the population ages and people seek new ways to express themselves or understand others that have issues communicating.
