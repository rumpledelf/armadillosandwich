  Armadillo Sandwich Pty Ltd is an umbrella style company responsible for, among other things, the <a href="http://tendthedrop.com" rel="nofollow">Tend the Drop</a> service, and maintaining the <a href="https://photographicdictionary.com" rel="nofollow">Photographic Dictionary</a> and <a href="http://videographicdictionary.com" rel="nofollow">Videographic Dictionary</a> websites.

<h3>Tend the Drop</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://tendthedrop.com" rel="nofollow">Tend The Drop</a> is on a mission to collect all the old, neglected, orphan Drupal sites in Australia (and then the world!) and give them a shot at a longer, healthier life through our fixed price Drupal site maintenance service.

<h3>Photographic & Videographic Dictionaries</h3>
<p>
  These sites currently appeal to older, educated women with children. I get very positive feedback from people who have children with learning disabilities or relatives with brain injuries. I am currently adding some new features to the sites that will increase the usefulness of the sites to these demographics based on this feedback.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently seeking funding to increase the viewership of these sites, by creating more content and marketing that content to a broader audience. The appeal of these sites will only increase as the population ages and people seek new ways to express themselves or understand others that have issues communicating.
