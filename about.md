Armadillo Sandwich Pty Ltd, formerly known as Hidden Waters Technology, was founded in 2006. Armadillo Sandwich relocated from rural South Australia to Sydney EOFY 2013. The company formerly focused on website development work in Drupal, and is currently based at <a href="http://www.hubaustralia.com">Hub Sydney</a> in Darlinghurst.

There is a small group of people working for Armadillo Sandwich in various capacities from Drupal development to content entry to Ruby on Rails development, but if you're going to meet anyone out and about in Sydney it will be the founder, Robyn Stanley. She has around 20 years of software development experience, which, along with making her feel old, means she has spent an awful lot of time figuring out what people want - and giving it to them.
