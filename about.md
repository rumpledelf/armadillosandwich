Armadillo Sandwich, formerly known as Hidden Waters Technology, was founded in 2006. Armadillo Sandwich relocated from rural South Australia to Sydney EOFY 2013. The company formerly focused on website development work in Drupal, and still does Drupal work occasionally but mostly just exists for the paperwork these days.

There are some future plans, but they mostly involve houses not websites.
