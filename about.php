There is a small group of people working for Armadillo Sandwich in various capacities from content entry to Ruby on Rails development, but if you're going to meet anyone out and about in Sydney it will be the founder, Robyn Stanley. She has around 20 years of software development experience, which, along with making her feel old, means she has spent an awful lot of time figuring out what people want - and giving it to them.
